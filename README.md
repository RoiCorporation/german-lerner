# Welcome to the German lerner!

This is a tiny script I developed a few years ago to help me learn German vocabulary
quickly and reliably, through sheer repetition. Back when I began to design this tool,
I didn't know of other useful resources yet (i.e., Anki), so I battled on and developed
this simple tool myself.

I am planning on turning this learner into a web application and expanding its features
somehow (adding user registrations, including images in the vocabulary questions instead 
of just text,...). In any case, that's not a project I'm planning on doing in the short 
term.

If you would like to use, modify or develop your own version of this learner, feel free
to do so. That said, I wish you the best on your road to master the German vocabulary. 
Happy learning!
